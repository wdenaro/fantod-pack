# Edward Gorey: Fantod Pack

This is a very simple Single Page Application (SPA) that will display a random tarot card, along with the associated terms that pertain to that card. The card data is stotred within a mySQL database. The images are scans of physical cards.

### Please Note
One of the 21 cards is NOT an Edward Gorey Fantod card, it is a phantom card, created by me, using E.G. artwork... it does not exist in the real world.
